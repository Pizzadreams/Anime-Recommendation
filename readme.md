# Anime Recommendation Project

## High level overview
1. Choose an anime API: I need to pick one of the available anime APIs, such as AniList API, Kitsu API, or Jikan API and obtain an API key.
2. Plan my application: I have to decide what prompts I want to ask the user and how I will use the API information to make a recommendation. For example, I could ask the user about their preferred genre, episode length, and target audience, and then use that information to search for anime that match those criteria.
3. Write code to access the API: I will use the requests library in Python to access the API and retrieve information about anime. I will construct a URL with my API key and the parameters for my search, and then make a GET request to the API. The API will return the results in JSON format, which I can then parse using the json library.
4. Store the results: I will store the results of the API call in a data structure, such as a list or dictionary, so that I can access and manipulate the information easily.
5. Write code to make a recommendation: Based on the information from the API and the answers to the prompts, I will write code to make a recommendation for an anime. I could use a simple algorithm, such as selecting the anime that has the highest score based on the user's criteria, or a more complex algorithm, such as using machine learning to make a prediction based on the user's answers.
6. Present the recommendation: Finally, I will present the recommendation to the user in a user-friendly way, such as by printing the recommendation to the console or by displaying it in a graphical interface.
